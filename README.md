## Introduction

This is a Power BI project on road accidents of major cities in the United Kingdom. The project is to analyze and derive insights to answer crucial questions and help stakeholders make informed data driven decisions in order to reduce and eventually prevent road accidents within these major cities. After several meetings with various stakeholders and departments within my company to gather requirements, my company asked me to create a “Road Accident Dashboard” for year 2021 and 2022, so that they can have insight on the gathered requirements.

## Gathered Requirements

1)	Primary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY growth
2)	Primary KPI’s - Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth
3)	Secondary KPI’s – Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for Current Year
4)	Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Current Year and Previous Year
5)	Casualties by Road Type for Current Year
6)	Current Year Casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night
7)	Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location

## Stakeholders

-	Ministry of Transport
-	Road Transport Department
-	Police Force
-	Emergency Services Department
-	Road Safety Corps
-	Transport Operators
-	Traffic Management Agencies

## Modeling
Automatically derived relationships are adjusted to remove and replace unwanted relationships with the required.

There data model involved a single one dimension table and one fact table. The dimension table is joined to the fact table by  one-to-many relationship.

## Visualizations

The report comprises of a page with two slicers and diverse visuals that interact with each other. You can interact with the report [here](https://app.powerbi.com/links/pccHKcXIRj?ctid=3327555b-876a-470a-b0cf-ded3db22f2b5&pbi_source=linkShare)

## Features 

Two slicers were added to depict;

## Data Analysis Touchpoints

From analyzing visuals obtained, it can be seen that;
-	Over 50% of casualties were caused by cars.
-	Most of the accidents (more than 70%) happened on a single carriageway.
-	Almost 60% of the accidents happened in the Urban areas.
-	Over 70% of these accidents happened during the day.

## Conclusion and recommendation

Based on the data analysis report outlining the results, here are some recommendations for stakeholders:
1. Improve Road Safety Measures for Cars: 

Given that over 50% of casualties were caused by cars, it is essential to focus on improving road safety measures specifically targeting car-related accidents. This could include initiatives such as raising awareness about safe driving practices, enforcing stricter traffic regulations, and implementing technology-based solutions like advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to mitigate risks associated with car accidents. Stakeholders should collaborate with relevant authorities, law enforcement agencies, and automotive manufacturers to implement effective measures to reduce car-related casualties.

2. Enhance Safety Measures on Single Carriageways: 

Since the majority of accidents (more than 70%) occurred on single carriageways, it is crucial to prioritize the enhancement of safety measures on these road types. Stakeholders should consider investing in infrastructure improvements, such as widening roads, adding safety barriers, improving road signage, and implementing effective traffic calming measures. Additionally, promoting driver education and awareness programs specific to single carriageways can help reduce accidents in these areas. By addressing the unique challenges associated with single carriageways, stakeholders can significantly improve road safety.

3. Focus on Urban Areas: 

With almost 60% of accidents happening in urban areas, it is evident that specific attention should be given to improving safety in these locations. Stakeholders should consider implementing measures such as enhanced traffic management systems, pedestrian safety initiatives, improved infrastructure for cyclists, and the creation of pedestrian-friendly zones. Collaborating with local government bodies, urban planners, and community organizations can help identify and address the specific factors contributing to accidents in urban areas, thus reducing the overall number of incidents.

4. Daytime Safety Measures: 

Since over 70% of accidents occurred during the day, stakeholders should focus on improving safety measures during daylight hours. This may include campaigns to raise awareness about safe driving practices, highlighting the importance of vigilance and alertness even in familiar surroundings. Furthermore, stakeholders can consider conducting targeted educational programs and driver training initiatives to address common causes of daytime accidents, such as distracted driving or speeding.

It is important for stakeholders to collaborate with relevant government agencies, law enforcement, community organizations, and other stakeholders to implement these recommendations effectively. Regular monitoring and evaluation of implemented measures will be critical to assess their impact on reducing accidents and casualties. By prioritizing these recommendations, stakeholders can make significant strides towards improving road safety and preventing accidents in the identified areas of concern.
